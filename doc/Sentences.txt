a man bought a car in Paris
all my friends love to party in Florida
big red foxes have been jumping the fence
all my students claim that my shirts are ugly
a few dogs were chasing the kids in the woods
I go to the gym everyday
Jack watches football on sundays
all my friends love to party
I ride a bike to class
the program is very challenging
I like watching football on sundays
I just bought the book you recommended
I like to have coffee in the morning
this is the best pizza in town
