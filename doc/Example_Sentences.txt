# Example Sentences

Recording standards for our audio files:

- 44 kHz 16 bit
- WAV PCM format

Use a mobile phone with some app for recording. If you have a recommendation, let everybody know via Slack.


We will focus here on contrastive stress on:

- subject
- verb
- object
- locative preposition phrase (or other such predicative modifiers)

Each recording consists of a plain declarative intonation using the unmarked or default word order, an answer to a question like "what happened":

- A man bought a car in Paris.

Then we generate all contrastive alternations:

- I say that "a woman" (bought a car in Paris), and you answer: No, "a man" (bought a car in Paris)
- I say "stole" (a man __ a car in Paris), and you answer: No, a man BOUGHT a car in Paris.

So all variants will be:

- a man bought a car in Paris
- A MAN bought a car in Paris
- a man BOUGHT a car in Paris
- a man bought A CAR in Paris
- a man bought a car IN PARIS

In addition we generate a recording with verum focus, that is, we emphasize the truth value of the proposition:

- a man DID buy a car in Paris

- all my friends love to party in Florida
