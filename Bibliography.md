- Dialog-act classification using CNNs https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/linguistik/sfb732/files/_100217__mgk.pdf (has acoustic model), Modeling the intonation of discourse segments for improved online dialog act tagging long paper  short paper (models acoustic-prosodic values as n-grams with maximum entropy model; better performance than just using raw prosodic contour)

- Exploiting prosodic features for dialog act tagging in a discriminative modeling framework http://sail.usc.edu/publications/files/RangarajanInterSpeech2007.pdf (same authors as previous paper, their first foray into adding acoustic features?)

- Multi-level Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Dialog Act Classification http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1185.pdf

- Using Context Information for Dialog Act Classification in DNN Framework http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D17/D17-1231.pdf

- Dialogue Act Modeling for Automatic Tagging and Recognition of Conversational Speech https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/CL-dialog.pdf (old, similar to the earlier Jurafsky paper; has list of all the Switchboard speech acts and example sentences for them)

- Lexical, prosodic, and syntactic cues for dialog acts https://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/publications/lexical_prosodic_and_syntactic_cues_for_dialog_acts.pdf (focuses on other DAs, backchannels, acknowledgements, continuers, assessments, yes-answers, agreements, incipient-speakership)

- Dialog Act classification from Prosodic features using SVMs https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c606/611c605fa6ca626e7b95e0fa54153435be2b.pdf
